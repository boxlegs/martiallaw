# Martial Law Spell
This is a play on the "Hellfire" spell mod made by [D1GQ](https://github.com/D1GQ/MoreSpells), who also made the [BlackMagicAPI](https://github.com/D1GQ/BlackMagicAPI) that enables this kind of tomfoolery. Additional config setup came courtesy of Walthzer's [template](https://github.com/Walthzer/MageArenaModTemplate/tree/master) . Pretty much all of the logic/data is ripped straight from Hellfire bar a few tweaked values. 

### How 2 Play
Simply invoke the patriot within by uttering one of the below:

- "I Declare Martial Law!"
- "B2 Bomber!"
- "Save Me Donald Trump!"

Open to more suggestions.
